##In this first exercise, we use sql to refine our search to yankee players who have hit 40 or more homeruns in one season
query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,HR FROM Batting 
WHERE teamID='NYA' and HR>=40"

sqldf(query)

#-------------------------
##After that, we adjust our search to any player who has hit between 40 and 60 homeruns in one season

query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,HR,SO FROM Batting WHERE
HR>40 and SO<60"

sqldf(query)

#------------------------
##In exercise three, we adjust search for Phillidelphia players who hit more than 30 homeruns in one season (between 1970 and 1979)

query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='PHI' and yearID>1969 and yearID<1980 and HR>30"

sqldf(query)

#------------------------
##Next, our search is reconfigured to list players who have hit more than 50 homeruns in one season

query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE HR>50 ORDER BY HR DESC"

sqldf(query)

#------------------------
##The exercises continue, this time with an end game of players who were struck out less than 10 times during a season they were up to bat at least 400

query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,SO,AB FROM Batting
WHERE SO<10 and AB>=400
ORDER BY SO"

sqldf(query)
